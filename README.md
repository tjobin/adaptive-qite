# Varational Time-Step Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution
Developed and studied a modified version of the Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution algorithm with an adaptive time-stepping mechanism based on evolution velocity. The aim is to reduce total circuit depth and iteration count by allowing larger steps in flat energy landscapes.
